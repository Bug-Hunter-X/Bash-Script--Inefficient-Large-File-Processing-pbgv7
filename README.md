This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in Bash scripts when dealing with large files. The `bug.sh` script processes a file line by line using a `while` loop and `read`. While functional for smaller files, this approach becomes inefficient and slow with large input, potentially leading to noticeable delays or even resource exhaustion. The `bugSolution.sh` script shows a more efficient alternative using `xargs` for improved performance.  Both scripts are provided for comparison and learning.
